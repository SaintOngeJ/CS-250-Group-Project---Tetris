1.	Game pieces (Tetrominoes): define 2D arrays to store the 7 Tetrominoes
	shapes and the corresponding arrays after rotating them in four angles
	(left to right).
	
2.  Main game board: Use a 2D array to represent the main game board (10 x 20).
	- Display the game on the console first to simulate the game.
	- Talk to Prof. Nguyen about mapping the 2D array into a GUI
		* merge the piece array into the game board array.

3.  GUI sketch:
	- game menu
	- start/pause/resume buttons
	- new game button
	- leaderboard button
	- labels to show the current game score or time
	- buttons or instructions to move/rotate the pieces
	
4.  Complete the design for the project (GUI, class, data, methods, etc.)
